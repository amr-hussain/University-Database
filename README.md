# University Database

## Description
This project involves designing and implementing a university database system. It includes the following steps:
1. Creating an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** to model the database structure.
2. Mapping the ERD into relational tables.
3. Writing SQL scripts to:
   - Create tables.
   - Seed the database with sample data.
4. Performing various **DDL (Data Definition Language)** commands to manipulate the database schema and structure.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate database design principles, normalization, and practical use of SQL commands.
